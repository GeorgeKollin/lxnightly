HOW TO USE
----------

By the time the installation finishes, two ".desktop" files are created. Just double-click on "nightmode.desktop" file, to launch the program. When you click on it, a window appears.

    Features explained:
    
        Latitude of your current position (Degrees - optional): Move the slider, from left to right and vice versa to adjust your position latitude in degrees.
    
        Longitude of your current position (Degrees): Move the slider, from left to right and vice versa to adjust your position longitude in degrees.
        
        ZIP Code of your current location (optional): Enter the ZIP Code of your area. Replaces latitude and longitude. You must check the "Use ZIP Code instead of longitude & latitude" checkbox, to send the value to f.lux®.
        
        Screen colour temperature (Kelvin): Move the slider, from left to right and vice versa to adjust the screen colour temperature in Kelvin.
        
        Change desktop icon theme (optional): Choose an option from the list, to change the colour theme of the desktop icons.
        
        [-r 1] (use randr): Add [-r 1] parameter to f.lux® cmd command.
        
        [-nofork]: Force f.lux® to stay active in terminal. It must be always inactive.
        
        Use ZIP Code instead of longitude & latitude: Check this in order to send the ZIP Code value, which you've entered, as an f.lux® parameter.
        
        Show command line output: If you enable this option, the command line buffer, after command execution, will appear inside a textbox.
        
        Use daytime filter (BETA): Apply f.lux® night time filter, even when it's daytime. The filter will be applied for 7 - 8 hours. Then, you have to apply it again.
        
        Turn off f.lux®: This button terminates all f.lux® sessions.
        
        Exit: Close the dialog window.
        
        Apply changes & turn on f.lux®: This button saves your preferences and starts a new f.lux® session, which is based on them.
        
        F.lux® exit status: You can use this exit code for debugging (For advanced users).
